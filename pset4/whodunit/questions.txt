1- What’s stdint.h?

A C header file that provides a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types.

What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

They are types which have a predefined number of bytes.

How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

BYTE: 8 BITS
DWORD: 4 BYTES or 32 BITS
LONG: 32 BITS or 4 BYTES
WORD: 16 BITS

What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

ASCII: B M
Hex:   0x424d

What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

bfSize is the total size of the BMP, biSize is the size of the bitmap header

What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

The bitmap has been stored backwards

What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

biBitCount

Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

Because it is in "r"(read) mode, it will try to find files even if they are not present.

Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

Because we need only 1 struct.

What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

3.

What does fseek do?

Tells the position in the file.

What is SEEK_CUR?

SEEK_CUR "specifies that offset is a count of characters from the current file position".
